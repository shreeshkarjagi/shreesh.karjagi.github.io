Under Dr. Jacob Schmidt's guidance, I helped develop and teach the introduction to ECG design curriculum alongside three other talented bioengineering seniors across four quarters (Winter 2022, Fall 2022, Winter 2023, Spring 2023). Our team created comprehensive lab modules, designed assignments, and prepared teaching materials to effectively guide students through circuit analysis, biomedical sensing, and prototype development.

### Course Overview

This hands-on engineering course introduces first-year students to biomedical device design through practical projects. In UCLA's Makerspace, students learn:
- Circuit design and Arduino Programing 
- Digital fabrication with 3D printing and laser cutting
- Cardiac signals and ECG interpretation 
- PCB design fundamentals
- Programming basics for signal processing

Students spend three hours in supervised labs and three hours on independent work weekly. Working in teams, they design and build functioning ECG devices interating initial prototypes to final working systems with personalized project extensions. The quarter culminates in project presentations where teams demonstrate their ECGs and discuss their technical design choices.
